This was the first time I applied from the festival open forms and was given a space in Artibarn. Our activities were held in the evenings, from 20 to 00:30. 

Marge was in her Acroyoga moment, and one of the projects I did was this interactive LED suit for her and Sven. They lately performed at the Dome with that.

She has also [written and article](https://medium.com/@MargebB/arduino-led-acrosuit-ozora-2014-c12cbdb8a83f) about this experience.
