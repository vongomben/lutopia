<p>

I had the honour to be interviewed by an Italian podcast I follow, Illuminismo Psichedelico, about hosting a workshop in a TAZ. 
I also talk about peer-to-peer communication systems and Festival Trackers in general, namely based on Meshtastic.

The youtube video has English subtitles, and also simplified Chinese and Brazilian Portuguese one, possibly not working properly (we are trying to fix this, our apologies...)
