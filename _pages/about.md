We've been hosting this workshop at Ozora's Artibarn since 2013, and we love the evening mood Ozora gives for creating and chatting, in its calm and talkative venue. The best place to chill and learn how to decorate your cloth / outfit or simly come to repair some camping electronics :)

We are wandering in Ozora, hopefully finding a space at Microcosmos next year.

A BIG tanks to all the people that helped and joined Lutopia in the years, falling in love - at least once - for Ozora: Katia Sven Andrea Marcella Tito Eleonora Vincenzo Livia Ilaria Marta Lorenzo Mitch Stefania Valentina Valentina Chiara Andindi -
